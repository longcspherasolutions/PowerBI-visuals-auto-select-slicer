# Auto select slicer

The **Auto Select Slicer** is a straightforward Power BI visual that filters data based on the selected option. Unlike the default slicer visual, the **Auto Select Slicer** always defaults to the first available option. If the current selection is removed by another slicer, the **Auto Select Slicer** will automatically select the next available option.
